# InvisibleCloak

## How to Run:
- Run background.py file and it will capture the background image using Webcam.

- Run invisible_cloak.py and it will use Webcam for live capturing all red coloured things and will overlap it with image captured in background.py, thereby, creating an illusion that all red coloured stuff will get invisible.

As per users wish they can modify it by setting the colour values in "invisible_cloak.py"
